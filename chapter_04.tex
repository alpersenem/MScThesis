\chapter{FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHODOLOGY}\label{Ch4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This chapter discusses four different methods for performing fault diagnosis. First of all, different signal processing methods are applied to the 1-phase current signal and compared with classical machine learning and deep learning methods. In the context of the thesis, two different comparisons are made. The first is to examine the advantages and disadvantages of different feature extraction scenarios and compare them with various metrics, while the second is to examine deep learning methods as an end-to-end solution.
\section{Classical Machine Learning Analysis}

Classical machine learning methods need preprocessing for feature extraction, albeit in different ways. These features, which will be used for fault detection, directly affect the performance of the classifier. Within the scope of this thesis, three different signal processing for classical machine learning methods and the calculated features based on this process will be examined. In addition, the responses of the VFD powered motor to different speed and load scenarios are also covered.

\subsection{Time domain statistical analysis}
\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/method1.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{Diagram of time-domain statistical analysis method.}	
	\label{method1}
\end{figure}
The first method is to extract the statistical properties of the current data in the time domain and to diagnose faults with machine learning techniques over them. Statistical features such as kurtosis, skewness, mean, RMS, standard deviation and median are extracted in the Knime to be used as features to predict whether the motor is healthy or faulty. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/sne_current.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{t-SNE plot of time-domain statistical features.}	
	\label{snec}
\end{figure}

In order to examine the distributions of these features in different classes, t-SNE, a manifold learning technique that reduces high-dimensional data to two or three dimensions, was used \cite{van2008visualizing}. It is widely preferred because it can capture nonlinear structures by exploiting local relationships between data points. It is employed to reduce the 6-dimensional feature space to 3 dimensions. It seems that a short-circuit fault between the stator windings and bearing fault can be differentiated from the healthy condition, while a 1-bar broken rotor fault is relatively more difficult to differentiate. This situation can be understood as it does not change the motor behaviour for 1-bar broken rotor failure, but when classification is made with machine learning methods, it is seen that there are algorithms with high performance.

\subsection{Frequency domain statistical analysis}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/method2.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{Diagram of frequency domain statistical analysis method.}	
	\label{method2}
\end{figure}
As a second method,  by applying Welch's PSD estimation to the current signal, analysis became possible in the frequency domain. After the statistical properties of the amplitudes in the frequency domain were extracted, classification algorithms were applied. As in the first method, statistical properties such as kurtosis, skewness, mean, RMS, standard deviation and median are extracted in the Knime for cases where the motor is healthy or faulty.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/sne_psd.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{t-SNE plot of frequency domain statistical features.}	
	\label{snep}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from the t-SNE plot, a short-circuit fault between the stator windings and a bearing fault can be better differentiated from the healthy condition than the first method, while 1 bar-broken rotor fault is still relatively more difficult to distinguish. According to the classification performance results, it is seen that a high rate of success can still be achieved.

\subsection{Statistical analysis on characteristic frequencies}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/method3.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{Diagram of statistical analysis of characteristic frequencies method.}	
	\label{method3}
\end{figure}
As a third method, by applying Welch's PSD estimate to the current signal, analysis in the frequency domain became possible. Specific fault frequencies in the frequency domain were calculated, then the corresponding amplitudes were calculated. By applying statistical measures such as mean and standard deviation to the amplitudes, six features were created for each condition and classification algorithms were applied to these features. In this method, signal processing and feature extraction computed in Matlab, followed by classification in Knime.

Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis researches for induction motors have been going on for many years and accordingly, there is a wide knowledge accumulation. Studies in the frequency domain have shown that fault conditions will have certain signs in the frequency spectrum. In this study, using the characteristic frequency equations for bearing, stator and rotor faults given in the literature review section (equations \ref{bearingfault}, \ref{statorfault} and \ref{rotorfault}), it has been calculated up to certain harmonics, and then the mean and standard deviation of the amplitudes corresponding to the frequencies obtained for each fault type are calculated and statistical features are formed.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300pt,keepaspectratio=true]{./fig/sne_mcsa.PNG}
	% sekil3.eps: 0x0 pixel, 300dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=14 14 1155 740
	\caption{t-SNE plot of characteristic frequencies statistics.}	
	\label{snem}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from the t-SNE plot, all faults can be better distinguished from the healthy state than the first and second method. According to the classification performance results, the third method outperforms the other two methods in almost every metric and every classifier.

\subsection{Discussion}

Due to their operating principles, classical machine learning methods are dependent on data engineering. Features revealed as a result of data engineering can better capture the fault characteristic. As can be seen from the table \ref{compare}, statistical approaches generally yield good results. Another advantage of statistical features is that they can be used in prognostic studies by observing their changes over time. 

Although the statistical study (M1) in the time domain gives good results compared to its simplicity and computational load, it is more vulnerable to external influences. It is useful to approach it carefully, as it is prone to give false results under distorting influences.

PSD estimation with the Welch's method is more resistant to disruptive effects due to its properties. While the higher computational load is a disadvantage, it has the potential to show effects that cannot be seen in the time domain. For this reason, it is also used especially in industrial standards. Considering the performance metrics, although second method (M2) gives close results with the study in the time domain, it can be preferred because it is resistant to external effects.

The characteristic effects of faults on motor current have been known to academic and industrial researchers for a long time. The disadvantage of this method is that it gives good results only under nominal load and speed conditions. However, as revealed in this study, it can be said that it is both a high-performance and robust method by statistically examining the amplitudes at characteristic frequencies (M3) under different speed and load conditions. As the table \ref{compare} exhibits, it outperforms for each performance metric and each classifier compared to other methods.
