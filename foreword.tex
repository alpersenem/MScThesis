First of all, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Dr Şeniz Ertuğrul, for his guidance and support since my undergraduate years. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Dr Murat Imeryüz for teaching me about induction motors and for his valuable contributions.

I would like to thank my friend and colleague Burak Gökçen for his unwavering support from the very first day, and Sarper Öztürk, who made up for what I lacked with his knowledge of induction motors and conducted long and boring experiments with fun. I would also like to thank Wat Motor R\&D Manager Barış Tuğrul Ertuğrul for his support and belief in me, and my team leader Sinan Unan for his understanding throughout my thesis.

I cannot thank enough to my beloved family and my dear fiance Damla Özyazgan, who have not spared their faith and support for me, for being there for me whenever I need it. If it were not for them, I would not be here.

Last but not the least, I am grateful to the technicians at the Wat Motor General Purpose Industrial Motor Laboratory for their crafty handiwork and effort.
