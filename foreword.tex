First of all, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Dr. Şeniz Ertuğrul, for her guidance and support since my undergraduate years. Thank you Prof. Dr. Mustafa Bağrıyanık and Prof. Dr. Levent Eren for agreeing to serve on my committee. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Murat Imeryüz for teaching me about induction motors and for his valuable contributions.

I would like to thank my friend and colleague Burak Gökçen for his unwavering support from the very first day, and Sarper Öztürk, who made up for what I lacked with his knowledge of induction motors and conducted long and boring experiments with fun. I would also like to thank Wat Motor R\&D Manager Barış Tuğrul Ertuğrul for his support and belief in me, and my team leader Sinan Unan for his understanding throughout my thesis.

I cannot thank enough to my beloved family and my dear fiance Damla Özyazgan, who have not spared their faith and support for me, for being there for me whenever I need it. If it were not for them, I would not be here.

Last but not least, I am grateful to the technicians at the Wat Motor General Purpose Industrial Motor Laboratory for their crafty handiwork and effort.
